# "Machine Learning-based" Network Intrusion Detection for Cellular Devices

This project is made up of multiple modules that need to be run one after the other to get the output.

## Parser

The `lte-ids` folder consists of a parser for PDML files generated by wireshark. You can get these files either from the MobileInsight dataset or from a device capture using a tool such as QCSuper.

`parser.py` is the main script for:

- Generating PDML files from .mi2log files
- Parsing PDML files to get a standard log output
- Using DRAIN on the log files to create log-key structured output

`generate_deeplog_data.py` converts the DRAIN output to individual sessions that act as input to the Machine Learning models

## LSTM

The `DeepLog` folder consists of code to use an LSTM model to act as an anomaly detector.

`LogKeyModel_train.py` takes the input data and trains a model

`LogKeyModel_predict.py` uses the test data to generate metrics


## Transformer

The `Transformer` folder consists of code to use a Transformer model to do the same.

Use the `test.py` and `train.py` to test and train the model.

## srsLTE

This is a modified version of the srsLTE stack for the 4G-LTE protocol.

The `nas.cc` file consists of all the necessary changes to conduct the LTE attacks -- Attach Reject, Authentication Reject and IMSI Catching
